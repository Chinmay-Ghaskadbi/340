Dear Editor,

Please find enclosed the paper titled "Modeling Influencer Marketing 
Campaigns in Social Networks" which we are submitting for review in ACM 
Transactions on Social Computing.

The rise of influencers in social networks has made influecner marketing 
one of the most important marketing techniques.  However, identifying the 
best suited influencers for an advertizing campaign is a major challenge 
because its outcome depends on various circumstances (such as nature of 
the product being advertized, structure of the network, influence 
propagation, willingness to pay, etc.). In this work, we present 
an agent-based model (ABM) that can simulate the dynamics of influencer 
advertizing campaigns and help discover the best influencer marketing 
strategy.  We also validate our model and present simulation results for a 
variety of circumstances modeled using parametric inputs.  Our model can 
be used to simulate an advertizing campaign and its outcome to help make 
better informed marketing decisions.

Sincerely,
